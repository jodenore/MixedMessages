# Mixed Messages Project

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output.

## Prospect Generator:basketball:

_The Prospect Generator gives you a different scout report from different scouts with randomized skill sets and more!_

### What changes in every report?

- Name of Scout
- Where the player is from/team
- Scout Lingo/Saying

* Expression of Scout

* Primary Skill Set
* Secondary Skill
* Opinion on player based on `draftProspect._ppg`
* Age of player and Points per game average of player
* Draft Projection based on `draftProspect._ppg`

### Instructions

1. **at `draftProspect.name` set any name to the draftProspect.**
2. **run `draftProspect.generateScoutReport()` and `console.log(draftProspect.willMakeNba())`**

### Example
